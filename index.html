                My Favourite Video Game of all time. I grew up with this game as a Kid and I still play it to this date. 
                Super Mario 64 is a classic video game released in 1996 for the Nintendo 64 console. The game follows the adventures of Mario, a plumber who has been invited by Princess Peach to her castle. When Mario arrives, he finds out that Bowser, the main antagonist of the Mario series, has kidnapped Princess Peach and stolen the castle's Power Stars.
The game is a platformer where the player controls Mario through various levels, collecting Power Stars along the way. Each level has several tasks that the player must complete to earn a Power Star. The tasks vary from level to level and can range from defeating enemies to solving puzzles.
The game features a hub world, Peach's Castle, which serves as a central point from which Mario can access each level. As the player collects more Power Stars, more levels become available.
Super Mario 64 was a groundbreaking game at the time of its release, featuring 3D graphics and an innovative camera system that allowed the player to freely move the camera around Mario. It is considered one of the greatest video games of all time and has been remastered and re-released on multiple platforms over the years.
